Changes by @Alektryon:<br>
— Changed the default English cipher from NAEQ (New Aeon English Qaballa) to AQ (Alphanumeric Qabbala):  basically a continuous, non-redundant, alphanumeric sequence from 0 to Z=35;<br>
— Corrected some misspellings ("Forititude" -> "Fortitude", "Osirus" -> "Osiris", etc).<br>
— [March 22, 2023] Added the "Typhonian" category. Contains the received text "Wisdom of S'lba", from Kenneth Grant's "Outer Gateways".
